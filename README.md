Join this repo, and upload some information about yourself

Hi, my name is Bobby Ren. I started this repo to allow developers to fork it, make changes, and commit to their github repo. Then, they can create a pull request to merge it back into the main repo. 

Please use the following steps when you edit and commit this repo:

1. Fork it to your own github account.
2. Add a line or two to this file (README.md) with your name and something about yourself.
3. Commit changes locally, preferably using GitHub app for Mac.
4. Push changes to your github repo.
5. Create a pull request back into my main repo (BobbyRenTech/AboutBobbyRenTech).

You can also follow instructions here:
